### Prompt

The prompt supports customizable options, making it highly flexible to use.

<img src="https://github.com/Lolabird/trilium-chat/assets/89228316/754724ad-799d-42f1-90c4-c51f39258e23" alt="translation options" style="zoom: 33%;" />

The `{{language:English|Chinese|French}}` will be rendered as a dropdown component, allowing you to select the desired option directly when using it.

`{{activeNote}}` supports two types of messages: text and code. For text messages, the content will be rendered in the chat window as it appears in the note, with one exception - if it is an included note, it will be rendered as a link.

It is important to note that because Trilium stores text notes in HTML format, messages sent through `{{activeNote}}` will also be sent in HTML format. This is to provide AI with more information. The prompt can specify how the response should be formatted.

When using `{{activeNote}}`, AI may return HTML, but it will still be rendered as plain text because it is difficult to determine whether the returned HTML is formatting information or actual code. Markdown is easier to handle, and support for markdown rendering may be added in the future.

Prompts will be stored under the `#CHAT_PROMPTS` note. You can manually modify the order or content within it.

### Command

#### thread 

<img src="./media/image-20230607234407989.png" alt="image-20230607234407989" style="zoom:33%;" />

The `favor` command will prioritize the entry in the chat history and display a flag indicating its importance.

The `set` command replaces the current note with the chat content.

The `append` command inserts the current note at the end of the note. 

#### message

<img src="./media/image-20230607234443677.png" alt="image-20230607234443677" style="zoom:33%;" />

The new command, `insert`, allows you to insert the current message at the selected position of the cursor. 

The `set`, `insert`, and `append` commands support both text and code note types. 

### History

<img src="./media/image-20230607235219388.png" alt="image-20230607235219388" style="zoom:33%;" />

The chat history will be stored under the note labeled with the attribute `CHAT_HISTORY_HOME`. If such a note doesn't exist, it will be stored under the default "trilium-chat" note.

When opening the history or prompts, the search bar will be focused by default. You can navigate through the options using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, and select an option by pressing Enter.
